      "    ## Destination: Based on the research, I recommend Sousse as the top destination for swimming and partying in Tunisia. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cultural relevance**: While Tunisian culture may not be immediately associated with beach parties, many hotels in Sousse do offer foam parties or other events that cater to tourists. This suggests a willingness to adapt to Western-style entertainment.\n",
      "2. **Seasonal suitability**: Sousse has a Mediterranean climate, making it suitable for swimming and outdoor activities year-round. The summer months (June to September) are peak tourist season, but even in the spring (April to May) and autumn (September to November), the weather is pleasant, with average highs around 22¬∞C (72¬∞F).\n",
      "3. **Accessibility**: Sousse has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, with many hotels, restaurants, and attractions catering to international visitors. The city is also relatively easy to reach by air or car, with Tunis International Airport nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, Kef is a mountainous region with limited accessibility for tourists. While it offers stunning scenery and historic sites, it may not be the best fit for swimming and partying.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sousse-specific recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Beach parties**: Some hotels in Sousse offer foam parties or other beach events, such as the ones mentioned on TripAdvisor.\n",
      "2. **Swimming**: Sousse has several beaches with clear waters, including the popular Hamma Mallouha Beach.\n",
      "3. **Nightlife**: The city's medina (old town) has a lively nightlife scene, with many bars and clubs offering live music and cocktails.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for planning your trip:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Check the current events calendar to ensure that any beach parties or events are happening during your visit.\n",
      "2. Research hotels that cater to tourists and offer amenities like pools, spas, and entertainment options.\n",
      "3. Consider visiting Sousse in the spring (April to May) or autumn (September to November), when the weather is pleasant and there's less crowds than in peak summer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Sousse offers a great balance of culture, seasonal suitability, and accessibility for swimming and partying in Tunisia., Tunisia\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Local Currency:** The Tunisian dinar (TND) is the official currency, but euros are widely accepted in tourist areas. You can exchange currency at banks or use ATMs to withdraw local cash.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Calculate daily expenses based on meals, transportation, and activities to avoid overspending.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "    Practice polite bargaining techniques, such as starting low, being respectful, and showing interest in the product to get a better deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Be Aware of Tipping:** While tipping customs vary across countries, in Tunisia, 5-10% of your total bill is considered standard for good service.\n",

      "    Be mindful of local tipping practices when dining at restaurants or engaging with service staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider Credit Card Rewards and Transfer Fees:** If you're a credit card holder, consider transferring funds to a Tunisian bank account to avoid high transfer fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Earn rewards points by using your credit card for everyday expenses and redeeming them for travel-related purchases to maximize your benefits.\n",
